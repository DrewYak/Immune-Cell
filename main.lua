    -- the state machine we'll be using to transition between various states

    Called whenever we change the dimensions of our window, as by dragging
    out its bottom corner, for example. In this case, we only need to worry
    about calling out to `push` to handle the resizing. Takes in a `w` and
    `h` variable representing width and height, respectively.

--[[
    Called every frame, passing in `dt` since the last frame. `dt`
    is short for `deltaTime` and is measured in seconds. Multiplying
    this by any changes we wish to make in our game will allow our
    game to perform consistently across all hardware; otherwise, any
    changes we make will be applied as fast as possible and will vary
    across system hardware.

--[[
    A callback that processes key strokes as they happen, just the once.
    Does not account for keys that are held down, which is handled by a
    separate function (`love.keyboard.isDown`). Useful for when we want
    things to happen right away, just once, like when we want to quit.
]]
function love.keypressed(key)
    -- add to our table of keys pressed this frame
    love.keyboard.keysPressed[key] = true
end

--[[
    A custom function that will let us test for individual keystrokes outside
    of the default `love.keypressed` callback, since we can't call that logic
    elsewhere by default.

    drawing all of our game objects and more to the screen.
